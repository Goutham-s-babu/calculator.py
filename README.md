#  Command-Line Calculator in Python

This project is a simple command-line calculator built using **Python**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

##  Features

- Menu-based interface using text
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors
- Uses **functions** for each operation
- All inputs are taken using the `input()` function
- Runs in a loop until the user selects "Exit"

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The program displays a menu with operation options.
2. The user selects an option using the keyboard.
3. The program takes two numbers as input using `input()`.
4. It performs the chosen operation by calling the respective function.
5. The result is displayed, and the menu appears again.
6. The user can repeat this until they choose to exit.

##  File Structure


## ‚úÖ Example Usage

```bash

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 3
Result: 8.0


How to Run
1.Save the code to a file named calculator.py

2.Open your terminal or command prompt
